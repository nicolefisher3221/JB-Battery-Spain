Initial Release

JBBATTERY is different from all other lithium ion battery companies due to the reliability and performance of our cells. We specialize in selling high-quality lithium batteries for golf carts, forklifts, boats, RVs, solar panel banks, specialty electric vehicles, and more. So far we have distributed more than 15,000 batteries around the world.

Not only does JBBATTERY have one of the largest inventories of LiFEPO4 batteries in the world, we also have the ability to manufacture custom batteries for virtually any application. An example is our custom 24V, 36V and 48V batteries built specifically for trolling motors. Never before have boaters been able to travel further with a trolling motor battery.

This is what JBBATTERY specializes in, finding practical solutions for challenging energy situations. The ultimate goal of Lithium Battery Power is to meet the demand for efficient and reliable power for future generations. Please do not hesitate to contact JBBATTERY directly if you have any questions regarding the use of lithium batteries as the primary power source.
